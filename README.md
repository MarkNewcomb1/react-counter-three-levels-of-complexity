## React Counter - Three Levels of Complexity

This is a simple(?) counter app written in React, three ways:

1. Simple counter
Front-end only counter, using useState to track state of the counter
2. Counter with Redux
Also front-end only, but using Redux to manage the state
3. Full-stack counter
Full-stack using the front-end for the app, and back-end to store the number for the counter
